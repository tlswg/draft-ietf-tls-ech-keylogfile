          SSLKEYLOGFILE extensions for Encrypted Client Hello
               draft-rosomakho-tls-ech-keylogfile-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the SSLKEYLOGFILE format to
   support the logging information about Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)
   related secrets.  Specifically, it introduces two new labels:
   ECH_SECRET and ECH_CONFIG, which respectively log the HPKE [RFC9180]
   shared secret and the ECHConfig used for the ECH.  This extension
   aims to facilitate debugging and analysis of TLS connections
   employing ECH.

1.  Introduction

   Debugging protocols with TLS can be difficult due to encrypted
   communications.  Analyzing these messages in diagnostic and debug
   tools requires inspecting the encrypted content.  Various TLS
   implementations have informally adopted a file format to log the
   secret values generated by the TLS key schedule, aiding in this
   analysis.

   In many implementations, the file that the secrets are logged to is
   specified in an environment variable named "SSLKEYLOGFILE".
   [I-D.ietf-tls-keylogfile] standardizes this format.  With the
   introduction of [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] additional secrets are derived
   during the handshake to encrypt the ClientHello message.  This
   document extends the SSLKEYLOGFILE format to also offer support for
   the ECH extension to enable debugging aof ECH-enabled connections.
   The proposed extension can also be used with all protocols that
   support ECH, including TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] and QUIC
   [RFC9000][RFC9001].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels for ECH

   This document defines two new labels for SSLKEYLOGFILE format:
   ECH_SECRET and ECH_CONFIG.  Client SHOULD log those labels if it
   offered ECH regardless of server acceptance.  Server can log those
   labels only if it decrypted and accepted ECH from the client.  The
   32-byte Random from the Outer ClientHello message is used as
   client_random for these log records.  Client MUST NOT log those
   labels for connections that use GREASE ECH extension.

3.1.  ECH_SECRET

   This label corresponds to KEM shared secret derived during HPKE key
   schedule process.  Length of the secret is defined by KEM that was
   used for ECH.

3.2.  ECH_CONFIG

   This label is used to log ECHConfig that was used for construction of
   ECH extension.  Note that the value is logged in hexadecimal,
   similarly to other entries in SSLKEYLOGFILE.

4.  Client_random for other TLS 1.3 SSLKEYLOGFILE entries

   SSLKEYLOGFILE is using Random from ClientHello as the connection
   identifier.  This creates ambiguity since TLS handshake with ECH
   contains two different Random values in Outer ClientHello and Inner
   ClientHello.

   SSLKEYLOGFILE entries corresponding to TLS 1.3 secrets for
   connections that successfully negotiated ECH MUST use Random from
   Inner ClientHello.  In all other cases Random from Outer ClientHello
   is to be used.

5.  Security Considerations

   The applicability statement of [I-D.ietf-tls-keylogfile] also applies
   to this document: if unauthorized entities gain access to the logged
   secrets then the core guarantees that TLS provides are completely
   undermined.  This extension is intended for use in systems where TLS
   only protects test data.

   Access to ECH_SECRET record in SSLKEYLOGFILE allows attacker to
   decrypt ECH extension and defeat privacy benefits offered by the ECH.
   Security considerations described in SSLKEYLOGFILE are fully
   applicable to this extension.

   Ability to log KEM shared secret from HPKE key schedule introduces
   potential attack surface against HPKE process.  Implementers need to
   secure relevant APIs accordingly to ensure that no unauthorised party
   can extract the KEM shared secret.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
